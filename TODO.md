### Dialogue
 1. Greetings Soldier, you've been invited to join Planet Deathmatch. Where the best compete in one on one combat.
 2. To start, I'm obliged to teach you a few things.
 3. Using WASD and your Mouse (Analogue Sticks on Gamepad), walk over to the target.
 4. Walking 2 meters, I'm impressed. However there's now a bush in the way, try using Space (Left Trigger on Gamepad) to jump over it.
 5. Now, there's a tree in the way, it's a little tricky to just jump over, try using the jump pad.
 6. Whee!
 7. Whoa, hold on. There's an evil chess piece in the way! Attack with Left Mouse (Right Trigger on Gamepad) to attack. 
 8. That chess piece won't hurt us any more.
 9. Look a Shotgun, it fires multiple pellets. Go pick it up. 
10. You have multiple weapons, use the Q and E buttons (Shoulder Buttons on Gamepad) to switch them.
11. It's a target. Shoot it with your shotgun.
12. Now we can continue.
13. Look a Launcher, it deals splash damage. Go pick it up.
14. We're surrounded with Robots, attack!
15. Amazing.
16. Look a pistol, it deals incendiary damage. Go pick it up.
17. Now, use it to burn down the walls of crates.
18. We're out, you did it! You can continue shooting Robots, open the menu with Esc (Start on Gamepad) to fight other players.
19. If you ever forget the controls, open the menu with Esc (Start on Gamepad) and open Controls.
